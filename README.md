# Study the 2-D Haar wavelets and its application to image compression.

ðŸ“š "Digital Signal Image Processing" project (Artificial Intelligence, UniGe)

In this project i study the Haar wavelet and it's application to image compression. I show the differences between a Fast Fourier Transform compression and a Wavelet compression, explaining why the latter is the best.
